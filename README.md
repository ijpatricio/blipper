# Blipper

Blipper starts with the desire to be able to tinker with agentic coding, while on the go.

Not only on the go, but on a real system, with freedom and flexibility!
Interact in a browser, mobile, or at the desk as well, ofc.

- Remotely: I don't want things connecting to my computer, having to have it on, etc.
- Async: I want to give a task, be able to leave and catch up later, to continue from there.
- Multi-session: I might want to open more than 1 terminal.
- Disposable: I want to do that, in a VPS, which I can use for a couple of hours/days, then destroy.
- GitHub cli: I want, maybe to pull/push private repositories.

Inter act with URLs with SSL certificates:

blipper.<IP_ADDRESS>.ssl.ip

Then we may add to view our live results:
project1.<IP_ADDRESS>.ssl.ip => port 3010 
project2.<IP_ADDRESS>.ssl.ip => port 8080

It's all in Caddy.


Agents/Models/CLI:
- Claude Code: my daily drive for now, so that's how we start.
- More may be added out of the box, or just install them yourself after boot.
