# Product Requirements Document: Blipper

## Product Overview

**Blipper** is a web-based multi-terminal application that provides users with the ability to create, manage, and interact with multiple terminal sessions through a web interface. Built using modern web technologies, it offers a browser-based alternative to traditional terminal applications.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Terminal Management
- **Create Multiple Terminals**: Users can spawn multiple independent terminal sessions
- **Tab-Based Interface**: Each terminal session is displayed as a separate tab for easy navigation
- **Session Isolation**: Each terminal runs as an independent process with its own state

### 2. Real-Time Terminal Interaction
- **Live Terminal Output**: Real-time streaming of terminal output to the web interface
- **Input Handling**: Full keyboard input support including special keys and shortcuts
- **Responsive Resizing**: Automatic terminal resize based on browser window dimensions

### 3. Cross-Platform Support
- **Shell Detection**: Automatically detects and uses appropriate shell (bash on Unix/Linux, PowerShell on Windows)
- **Environment Inheritance**: Inherits system environment variables and user home directory

### 4. Web-Based Interface
- **Modern UI**: Clean, dark-themed terminal interface with customizable colors
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes and devices
- **Web Links Support**: Clickable links in terminal output

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js)
- **Express.js**: Web server for serving static files
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication between client and server
- **node-pty**: Pseudo-terminal interface for spawning shell processes
- **Process Management**: Automatic cleanup of terminal processes on client disconnect

### Frontend (Web)
- **XTerm.js**: Full-featured terminal emulator in the browser
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with the backend
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ class-based architecture for terminal management

## User Experience

### Primary User Flow
1. User opens the web application in their browser
2. Clicks "New Terminal" to create their first terminal session
3. Interacts with the terminal using keyboard input
4. Can create additional terminals as needed using tabs
5. Switch between terminals using tab navigation
6. Close terminals individually when no longer needed

### Key Interactions
- **Terminal Creation**: Single click to spawn new terminal
- **Tab Management**: Click to switch, X button to close
- **Input/Output**: Standard terminal keyboard shortcuts and commands
- **Window Resize**: Automatic terminal fitting to browser window

## Target Users

- **Developers**: Need quick access to command line without leaving their browser
- **System Administrators**: Managing remote systems through web interfaces
- **Students/Educators**: Learning command line in a controlled, accessible environment
- **Teams**: Collaborative development environments where terminals need to be shared

## Success Metrics

- **Responsiveness**: Terminal input/output latency under 100ms
- **Stability**: Zero memory leaks during long-running sessions  
- **Compatibility**: Works across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent users and terminal sessions

## Security Considerations

- Terminal processes run with the same permissions as the server process
- No built-in authentication or access controls
- Suitable for trusted environments or behind proper authentication layers
- Process isolation ensures terminals don't interfere with each other

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

- User authentication and session management
- Terminal sharing and collaboration features
- Customizable themes and terminal settings
- File upload/download capabilities
- Terminal session persistence and recovery
